# Google-Bash-Currency-Converter
A simple bash (Linux) script to pull currency data from the online "Google API"

I have programmed it fairly inefficiently but nonetheless it is polished and works elegantly.

Don't forget to change the permission using chmod 700 (for example) so that you may run the script (using ./script.sh).

The default setting is a Bitcoin to GBP conversion.  Change to the appropriate three character code (e.g. USD, EUR) as needed.  I had to guess that Bitcoin was BTC, so you may have to guess what three letters your chosen currency is too.

You can use this with a program such as genmon.  Genmon runs in the desktop panel and will re-run the command at specified intervals (e.g. update every five minutes).  Genmon displays the program output.  Essentially you can have the latest currency conversation rates as a permanent, realtime fixture on your desktop using this method.
